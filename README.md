### **Clone Repo**

I’ve created and configured the ASP.NET Core Web API inside the mono-repo structure.

- Web API project created
- Solution file generated
- Local development server tested successfully
- Confirmed API runs on [localhost](http://localhost) ( [http://localhost:5097](http://localhost:5097/) )

You don’t need to recreate anything.

Just pull/clone the repo and run (with cmd or vscode terminal):
## git clone https://github.com/UcheOnwe/Receipts-To-Spending-Tracker
## cd Receipts-To-Spending-Tracker
## cd backend-api
## cd api
## dotnet restore
## dotnet run
